```rust 
use std::io;
```

Imports the input/output library from Rust's standard library, which provides functionality for reading from and writing to the console.

rustfn main() {

Declares the main function, which is the entry point of a Rust program.

rust    println!("ASCII Converter");
    println!("Choose an option:");
    println!("1. Convert character to ASCII");
    println!("2. Convert ASCII value to character");

These lines print the program title and menu options to the console.

rust    let mut choice = String::new();

Creates a new mutable variable named choice that will store the user's menu selection.
String::new() creates a new empty String.
mut indicates that the variable can be modified.

rust    io::stdin().read_line(&mut choice).expect("Failed to read input");

io::stdin() gets a handle to the standard input stream.
read_line(&mut choice) reads a line of input from the user and stores it in the choice variable.
The &mut syntax passes a mutable reference to the choice variable.
expect("Failed to read input") handles any potential errors by displaying the message if reading fails.

rust    match choice.trim() {

Begins a pattern matching expression on the user's input after removing whitespace with trim().
The match statement will compare the input against various patterns (cases).

rust        "1" => {

The first case: if the user entered "1", execute the following code block.

rust            println!("Enter a single character:");

Prompts the user to enter a character.

rust            let mut input = String::new();
            io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read character");
            let input = input.trim();

Creates a new mutable string to store the character input.
Reads a line from the user and stores it in input.
Shadows the original input variable with a trimmed version (removing whitespace).

rust            if let Some(c) = input.chars().next() {

input.chars() creates an iterator over the characters in the input string.
next() gets the first character from that iterator, which returns Some(char) if there is a character or None if the string is empty.
if let Some(c) = ... checks if a character was found and binds it to the variable c.

rust                let ascii = char_to_ascii(c);
                println!("ASCII value of '{}' is: {}", c, ascii);

Calls the char_to_ascii function to convert the character to its ASCII value.
Prints the result, showing both the character and its ASCII value.

rust            } else {
                println!("Invalid input: no character entered.");
            }

If no character was entered, prints an error message.

rust        "2" => {

The second case: if the user entered "2", execute the following code block.

rust            println!("Enter an ASCII value (0 - 127):");

Prompts the user to enter an ASCII value.

rust            let mut input = String::new();
            io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read number");

Creates a new string to store the ASCII value input.
Reads a line from the user and stores it in input.

rust            match input.trim().parse::<u8>() {

Attempts to parse the trimmed input as an unsigned 8-bit integer (u8).
Begins another pattern matching expression on the result of the parsing operation.

rust                Ok(n) if n <= 127 => {

If parsing succeeded (returned Ok) AND the value is less than or equal to 127, execute this block.
The parsed value is bound to the variable n.

rust                    let character = ascii_to_char(n);
                    println!("Character for ASCII value {} is: '{}'", n, character);
                }

Calls the ascii_to_char function to convert the ASCII value to a character.
Prints the result, showing both the ASCII value and its corresponding character.

rust                _ => {
                    println!("Invalid input: enter a number between 0 and 127.");
                }

The catch-all pattern (_) that handles all other cases:

If parsing failed (returned Err), or
If the value is greater than 127


In either case, it prints an error message.

rust        _ => {
            println!("Invalid choice.");
        }

Another catch-all pattern for the outer match statement.
If the user didn't enter "1" or "2" for the menu choice, print an error message.

rust    }
}

Closes the outer match statement and the main function.

rustfn char_to_ascii(c: char) -> u8 {
    c as u8
}

Defines the char_to_ascii function that takes a character and returns an unsigned 8-bit integer.
Uses Rust's as keyword to cast the character to its numerical ASCII value.

rustfn ascii_to_char(n: u8) -> char {
    n as char
}

Defines the ascii_to_char function that takes an unsigned 8-bit integer and returns a character.
Uses Rust's as keyword to cast the number to its corresponding ASCII character.

This program is a simple command-line ASCII converter that allows users to:

Convert a character to its ASCII numeric value
Convert an ASCII numeric value to its corresponding character

The program handles basic input validation and provides helpful error messages when invalid input is received.
