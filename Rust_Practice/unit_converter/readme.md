✅ Step 1: Decide What Units You Want to Convert
Start small. Pick one category first, such as:

Temperatures (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)

Lengths (meters ↔ feet)

Weights (kilograms ↔ pounds)

Choose only one conversion at first, like "Celsius to Fahrenheit", so you don’t get overwhelmed.

✅ Step 2: Create a New Rust Project
If you're not in a project folder yet:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo new unit_converter
cd unit_converter
Open the src/main.rs file.

✅ Step 3: Think About the Input and Output
Ask yourself:

Will the user type something?

What do you want to print back?

What type will you store the input in? (String, f64, etc.)

For example:

Input: "25" (Celsius)

Output: "77 degrees Fahrenheit"

✅ Step 4: Use std::io to Read Input
Use let mut input = String::new() and io::stdin().read_line(...) to get input from the user.

Then use .trim() and .parse::<f64>() to turn the input into a number.

Why f64?

Because temperatures, weights, and lengths often include decimals (like 36.6°C or 1.75m)

✅ Step 5: Do the Math (Type Handling)
Once you have the number:

Do the conversion using the formula.

For example, Celsius to Fahrenheit is: F = C * 1.8 + 32

Rust will automatically do the math if your number is a valid f64.

✅ Step 6: Print the Result
Use println!() to show the answer to the user in a friendly way.

Example:

rust
Copy
Edit
println!("25°C is 77°F");
✅ Step 7: Expand It
Once the first one works:

Add a second converter, like meters to feet.

Use if or match to ask the user what type of conversion they want.

✅ Step 8: Handle Errors Simply
If the user types text instead of a number, .parse() will fail.

Use:

rust
Copy
Edit
if let Ok(number) = input.parse::<f64>() {
    // continue
} else {
    println!("That was not a valid number.");
}
That way, your program won't crash.

✅ Step 9: Test Different Inputs
Try:

Whole numbers (25, 100)

Decimal numbers (36.6)

Invalid inputs (like abc)

This helps you see if your converter handles all cases correctly.

✅ Step 10: Learn One Step at a Time
Once you're comfortable with:

Reading input

Parsing numbers

Doing math

Using if/else

Then you can:

Learn functions to clean up your code

Use enums to handle conversion types

Create loops to repeat the converter
